# Introduction

This repository contains all project that we are going to build in my **Django REST Framework + React.js + tailwindcss tutorial** course. it's videos soon will be availabe!

Prerequisites for this course:
- Familiarity with python and django.
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS.

# List of projects

- ## Poll REST API
    In this project we will learn the basics of Django REST Framework (DRF) including:
    - DRF building blocks (Serializer, Parser, Render, APIView, Filters, Router,...).
    - Writing Unit tests.
    - API Documentation and its tools.

- ## Todo App
    A simple **todo app REST API** that is designed with Django + Django REST framework.
    A simple **SPA** that consumes our todo apis. 

- ## Note keeping app
    As you may arleady know, there are two general approaches to building web applications today:
    - Traditional web application.
    - Single page application (SPA).

    In this project, I've tried to illustrate and compare these two approaches.

    ![Note app](https://github.com/0x-m/django-react-projects/blob/main/notes_app/docs/img/notes-notelist.png?raw=true)

    Initially, we build a simple **Note keeping app** solely with django (in tradtional way, using django views and templates). 
    
    Then,  A set of REST API endpoints (for authentication and note managing) will be developed.

    And finally, we will design a **SPA** for the Note keeping app using **react.js** .
  
- ## Blog REST API

- ## Online Shop SPA

    In this step, we are going to discuss about the **React.js** as a tool that improves 
    the **code quality** (Readability, Maintainablity, Reusability).

    > we have a **classic Online shop** template and we are going to **migrate** to react.js.
